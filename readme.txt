This simple plugin changes the user based permalink slug 'author' to anything you wish.
For example, you have an e-learning management system where different members teach on different topics. Each member has his unique profile url (author permalink) something like this: http://mukto.medhabi.com/author/mukto90
Now you wish the word 'author' to be changed to 'teacher'. So, this is the plugin you need.
